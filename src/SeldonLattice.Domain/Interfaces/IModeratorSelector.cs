/// Interface for dynamic moderator selection based on inquiry subject matter.

/// synthesis/storage code that wants to persist or surface the confidence reads
/// <see cref="ModeratorSelectionResult"/>Confidence. Returning a struct-style result
/// rather than a bare <c>IModerator</c> is deliberate: the confidence is what lets

/// 'Nietzsche won by default because nothing matched' - information the synthesis
/// layer needs when deciding whether to trust the moderator's frame verbatim.
